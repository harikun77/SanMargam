        <div class="dancer-bio-content">
          <p>Sahana Kumar embarked on her Bharatanatyam journey at the age of 5 under the guidance of Guru Smt. Roopa Suresh at the San Jose Branch of Vishwa Shanthi Dance Academy (VSDA), an institution renowned for its excellence in the California Bay Area. Over the past 11 years, she has performed in major VSDA productions, including Parampara and Infinite Facets, and completed her Arangetram in January 2024.</p>
          
          <p>Beyond Bharatanatyam, Sahana has trained in Carnatic music for 11 years under Smt. Geetha Ravi, deepening her grounding in rhythm and melody. She has also been an active member and leader in the Carnatic Chamber Concerts (CCC) community, serving as Senior Editor of the CCC magazine for the past three years, where she curates content celebrating young musicians while continuing to contribute through her own music.</p>
          
          <p>At Saratoga High School, where she is a senior, Sahana is deeply involved in the performing arts as a member of Choir, Drama, and Musical Theatre. She also thrives in the Media Arts Program (MAP), where she has directed, edited, and acted in projects that have secured nominations and awards in competitions. In addition, she is a Varsity Water Polo goalkeeper and a TEDx speaker, reflecting her diverse interests and leadership.</p>
          
          <p>Sahana's passion for service is equally strong. For six years, she has been part of USKids4Water's Spoken English Program (SEP), teaching English to students in rural Tamil Nadu villages. This work connects her artistry to community impact, embodying her belief in art and education as forces for change.</p>
