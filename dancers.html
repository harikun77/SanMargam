          <p>Sarika, a senior at Los Altos High School, began her dance journey under the guidance of Guru Smt. Shreelata Suresh at the age of 6. Beyond dance, she channels her passion for sustainability and mock trial, alongside her enthusiasm for science. Sarika actively participates in her school's Motorsport Club and dedicates time as a resource management steward for local Open Space Preserves. In her leisure, she finds joy in hiking, solving jigsaw puzzles, and delving into mystery novels. The Vishwa Shanthi Dance Academy community supports her not only in dance but also in exploring her cultural roots through dance photography.</p>

          <p>Kirthana is a junior at Aragon High School and is passionate about pursuing a future in medicine.

          <p>Kirthana's Bharatanatyam journey began at age nine under Guru Smt. Shreelata Suresh at Vishwa Shanthi Dance Academy. Over the years, she has performed at cultural events, libraries, and temples, refining her artistry and stage presence. She recently participated in VSDA's productions Infinite Facets and Kanha Kanna, which enriched her appreciation for Indian art forms and taught the value of collaboration and commitment. Earlier this year, she completed her arangetram, a solo debut performance and earned the title Natyapraveena, a distinguished milestone in a Bharatanatyam dancer's career.</p>
